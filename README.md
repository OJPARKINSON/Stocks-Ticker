# Lambda-portfolio

This repository is split into two parts, the first a Lambda API that gets the latest stock prices and the second is the RasberryPi display code that uses the api.

A Lambda API that uses the [Coinbase API](https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/) and the [alpaca.markets API](https://alpaca.markets]) hosted on AWS running on Lambda's.

The Lambda API was first written in JavaScript and then rewritten in GoLang to gain more experience with the language.

The JS is now Deprecated

To do:

- Fix coinbase query

- Add setup to use Vercel serverless functions
